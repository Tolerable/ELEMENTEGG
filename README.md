## Overview

ELEMENTEGG is a game where you raise an egg by selecting and combining elements from the periodic table. The gameplay involves several key phases:

1. **Element Selection:** Start with 3 element picks, which you can combine to influence the traits of your egg.
2. **Token Earning:** Gain tokens to use in a slot machine-like mini-game.
3. **Ore Collection:** Spin with your tokens to win ore, which can be redeemed for additional elements.
4. **Feeding the Egg:** Use the elements you win to feed the egg, shaping its eventual hatching.
5. **Hatching and Mini-Game:** Once the egg hatches, it enters a mini-game where it consumes resources to clear levels. The traits and skills developed during the raising phase affect its performance and lifespan.

The game is still in progress, with new features and enhancements being actively developed.
